# Available generators
OpenVeo plugins provide some generators:

  - [openveo-plugin](#app) (default: openveo-plugin:app)
  - [openveo-plugin:entity](#entity)


## App

This plugin provide many grunt tasks to generate and publish documentation, to minify and compile your code, to start tests ...

After that, you can start you OpenVeo server and see your plugin in your menu with an access to a TODO page.

  - `--skip-install` do not run `bower install` and `npm install` after generating the app, default is false (not skipping install)
