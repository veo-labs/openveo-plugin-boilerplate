# Introduction

End to end tests are performed using [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/) and run from [OpenVeo core](https://github.com/veo-labs/openveo-core).

You first have to install and configure tests as described in [core documentation](https://github.com/veo-labs/openveo-core).

# Write tests

All end to end tests must be located in **tests/client/e2eTests/**</br>
Suites must be described in **tests/client/protractorSuites.json**</br>
List of datas to create before launching tests must be available in **tests/client/e2eTests/database/data.json**
